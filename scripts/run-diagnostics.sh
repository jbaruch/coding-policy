#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Language-diagnostics gate (rules/language-diagnostics.md): run the
# headless engines over the first-party trees and fail on any finding so
# CI gates at zero. shellcheck is the engine behind bash-language-server;
# pyright is the Python engine (scope: pyrightconfig.json). Mirrors
# scripts/run-tests.sh — CI calls it on every PR (tests.yml) before the
# unit suites.
#
# Both engines always run (explicit rc capture, not error suppression per
# rules/error-handling.md) so one invocation surfaces every finding.
#
# `set -uo pipefail`, not `set -euo pipefail`: this script takes
# rules/error-handling.md Shell Error Handling's carve-out for a script
# running independent checks and reporting an aggregate. All four
# preconditions hold — shellcheck and pyright are independent; each rc is
# captured explicitly and aggregated into a non-zero exit; only `-e` is
# dropped; and the two setup steps that gate the checks — base-dir presence
# and engine presence — carry their own explicit checks below (per the
# carve-out's silent-corruption clause; the engines' own runs need no such
# guard, since their exit codes are exactly what this script captures).
#
# Output:
#   stderr: each engine's native findings plus per-engine progress.
# Usage: scripts/run-diagnostics.sh [base-dir]
#   base-dir  Tree whose skills/ and scripts/ are scanned for shell
#             scripts. Defaults to the repo root. The optional arg exists
#             so the runner's own test can point it at a fixture tree.
#             pyright always runs against pyrightconfig.json at the cwd,
#             independent of base-dir.
# Exit: 0 if both engines report zero findings, 1 on any finding, 2 on
#       setup error (base dir missing, no scripts found, engine absent).
