# Read a tile's current latest published version from the authoritative
# versions API (`tessl api v1/tiles/<ws>/<tile>/versions`).
#
# Extracted from verify-publish-landed.sh's inline fetch (it did this same
# read to derive conjunct 2's `current`) so the read has ONE hardened home:
# confirm-publish-landed.sh's post-publish gate and the publish-landed-gate
# composite action both need the same "what does the registry say now"
# answer, and rules/script-delegation.md wants that deterministic read in a
# single script, not reproduced per caller.
#
# Why the versions API and NOT `tessl plugin info`: the plugin-info search
# listing is eventually-consistent and lags the version API by minutes, so a
# freshly-landed publish reads back as "not published yet" through it — a
# false negative exactly when the caller is asking "did my publish land"
# (#181). The versions API reflects a publish immediately. capture-registry-
# baseline.sh reads plugin info for the PRE-merge baseline (staleness is fine
# before the publish); this script reads the versions API for the POST
# question (staleness is not).
#
# Sourceable AND runnable. verify-publish-landed.sh sources this file and
# calls `registry_version` as a function so an in-process `tessl` shell-mock
# (its unit suite) reaches the read; confirm-publish-landed.sh and the
# composite action run it as a subprocess. The EXIT-trap cleanup is installed
# inside main() (not at top level) so sourcing this file never clobbers the
# caller's own trap.
#
# Usage: registry-version.sh <workspace> <plugin>
# Out:   the numeric latest version (major.minor.patch) on stdout, or NOTHING
#        (empty, exit 0) when the tile has never published — an empty registry
#        is a valid first-publish baseline, not an error. Callers that require
#        a published version (verify-publish-landed.sh) treat empty as their
#        own error; callers capturing a baseline (the gate) treat it as "no
#        baseline yet".
# Exit:  0 on a successful read (published version OR never-published empty);
#        2 on tool/parse failure (tessl or jq absent, tessl unreachable,
#        non-JSON body).

# Script-global, NOT a main() local: the EXIT trap fires after main() returns,
# when a main-local would be out of scope and `set -u` would turn cleanup into
# an unbound-variable failure (same reasoning as capture-registry-baseline.sh).
# registry_version() also clears it inline on every return path, so the
# main-level EXIT trap is only a backstop for an unexpected signal.

# EXIT-trap cleanup. `return 0` is load-bearing: an EXIT trap's final command
# status becomes the script's exit status, so a failing `rm` here would rewrite
# a deliberate `exit 2` (rules/error-handling.md Shell Error Handling). `if !
# rm` rather than a bare `rm`: under `set -e` a failing rm would abort the
# handler before `return 0` runs, reintroducing the rewrite the handler exists
# to prevent; an `if` condition suspends `set -e`. Clears RV_ERR_FILE so a
# second call (inline cleanup then the backstop trap) is an idempotent no-op.
