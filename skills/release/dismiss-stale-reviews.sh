# Dismiss a gating bot's CHANGES_REQUESTED review once the SAME bot has
# posted a later non-CHANGES_REQUESTED verdict on the PR.
#
# Why this exists: the policy reviewers run as `github-actions[bot]`, which
# GitHub rejects `APPROVE` from with HTTP 422 (see
# .github/workflows/review-anthropic.md Step 5). A clean re-review is
# therefore a COMMENT ("All rules pass"), and a later COMMENT never
# supersedes an earlier CHANGES_REQUESTED in GitHub's merge-gating model —
# the stale CHANGES_REQUESTED keeps blocking the merge until it is
# dismissed. The bot cannot dismiss its own review (it holds only
# `pull-requests: read`), so the operator running the release skill does it
# here. The decision is fully deterministic, so it is a script, not agent
# judgment (rules/script-delegation.md).
#
# Decision, per gating bot (see GATING_BOTS below):
#   - latest review state == CHANGES_REQUESTED  => leave it; the bot is
#     currently requesting changes, nothing to dismiss.
#   - latest review state is anything else (COMMENTED/APPROVED) => dismiss
#     every EARLIER review from that bot still in CHANGES_REQUESTED.
# Reviews already in DISMISSED state are skipped, so re-running is a no-op
# (idempotent per rules/file-hygiene.md).
#
# Usage: dismiss-stale-reviews.sh <owner> <repo> <pr-number>
# Out:   one JSON object on stdout:
#   {
#     "pr_number": N,
#     "dismissed": [{"login": "...", "review_id": N, "commit_id": "..."}],
#     "left_active": [{"login": "...", "review_id": N}]  // latest is still CHANGES_REQUESTED
#   }
# Exit:  0 on successful query (including no-op); non-zero with a stderr
#        diagnostic on API/argument failure.
