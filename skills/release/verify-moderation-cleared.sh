# Wait for a published plugin version's moderation to clear, polling the
# registry with exponential backoff. Moderation is a post-publish install
# gate: a freshly published version can be blocked from `tessl install`
# until its moderation state reaches "pass". This is the release
# contract's third conjunct (rules/ci-safety.md) — a green publish run
# plus a registry advance does NOT confirm a release on its own.
#
# Signal (machine-readable JSON, not the `tessl plugin info` human text):
#   tessl api v1/tiles/<workspace>/<tile>/versions/<version>
#     .data.attributes.moderationStatus   ("pass" => cleared)
#     .data.attributes.moderationPassed    (bool; true => cleared)
#     .data.attributes.moderationError     (non-null => blocked)
#
# Backoff: the per-attempt delay starts at BASE_DELAY_SEC and doubles each
# attempt, capped at MAX_DELAY_SEC; the loop stops once cumulative sleep
# would exceed BUDGET_SEC. Constants below; override via the matching
# env vars (used by the test harness to keep runs fast).
#
# Transient fetch retry: a non-zero `tessl api` exit is retried inside the
# backoff loop up to FETCH_RETRY_MAX consecutive times before exiting 2, so
# a momentary CLI/network blip does not abort a wait for a release that
# published fine (issue #304). A successful fetch resets the counter.
#
# Fail-loud-at-budget: a still-pending OR blocked state when the budget is
# exhausted exits 1 — an unconfirmed release is never reported as success.
#
# Usage: verify-moderation-cleared.sh <workspace> <plugin> <version>
# Out:   JSON contract differs by exit code (per rules/script-delegation.md
#        "JSON-producing"):
#          - rc 0/1 (moderation finding): one JSON object on stdout
#              {"ok": bool, "reason": "<human text>",
#               "moderation_status": "<status-or-empty>",
#               "version": "<version>", "attempts": N, "elapsed_seconds": N}
#          - rc 2 (tool-state error): stderr-only diagnostic, stdout empty
#            (or, for the missing-jq guard, a minimal JSON envelope with the
#            same fields and "ok": false). Wrappers MUST parse stdout only
#            when exit code is 0 or 1.
# Exit:  0 moderation cleared; 1 blocked or still-pending at budget
#        exhaustion (fail loud); 2 argument-validation, jq-missing, or a
#        persistent `tessl api` failure (retried FETCH_RETRY_MAX times first).
