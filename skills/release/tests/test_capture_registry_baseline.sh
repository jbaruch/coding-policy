# The contract under test is the one the pasted pipeline in SKILL.md could
# not hold: a parse miss or a tool failure must exit 2 with a diagnostic,
# never emit an empty baseline. An empty baseline is the dangerous output —
# it flows into verify-publish-landed.sh's conjunct 2, where every version
# compares as "advanced past empty", so an unpublished release confirms.
#
# Approach: run the script as a subprocess with a stub `tessl` executable
# placed first on PATH, so the real `set -euo pipefail`, the EXIT trap, and
# the exit codes are all exercised end-to-end — a sourced-function harness
# would approximate them and miss exactly the trap/exit-status defects this
# script hit in development. The stub selects its fixture via MOCK_MODE.
# jq is not used by the script, so stdout is asserted literally.
#
# Run: bash skills/release/tests/test_capture_registry_baseline.sh
# Exit 0 on all-pass; non-zero with a per-test diagnostic on failure.
