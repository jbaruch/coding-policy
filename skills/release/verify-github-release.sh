# Answer ONE question, definitively: did run <run-id> publish a
# retrievable GitHub release at <tag> on <owner>/<repo>?
#
# This is the non-Tessl channel's published-artifact evidence
# (rules/ci-safety.md "Always Watch CI"). A package published by pushing
# a release tag — an ACR package published by `acr publish` from a
# tag-triggered workflow — has no registry to advance and no moderation
# state to clear, so the Tessl helpers say nothing about whether it
# landed. What answers that is the release itself: it exists at the
# exact tag the run published, it is not a draft, and its assets are
# retrievable.
#
# Two conjuncts, both required, neither substituting for the other —
# the tag/asset counterpart of verify-publish-landed.sh's pair:
#   1. The resolved run's `conclusion` is `success`
#   2. The release exists at the exact tag, is published, and every
#      asset is retrievable
# Conjunct 1 alone passes a run that uploaded assets and then failed a
# later step. Conjunct 2 alone passes an upload that never completed, a
# draft left unpublished, or a release created at a different tag.
#
# The run id comes from `resolve-publish-run.sh`; `gh run watch` on it
# is a timing precondition, never the gate. A run still in flight is
# INDETERMINATE (exit 2), the same reading verify-publish-landed.sh
# gives a `null` conclusion.
#
# Asset retrievability is read from GitHub's own `state` field: an asset
# mid-upload or failed reports something other than `uploaded`, and the
# download it fronts 404s. A release with zero assets is reported as a
# failed conjunct, never as a vacuous pass.
#
# Discriminating absent from indeterminate, the same way
# registry-has-version.sh does: `gh api` exits non-zero on a 404 AND on
# an auth or network failure, so a non-zero exit alone is not "absent".
# The `HTTP 404` in gh's diagnostic is the discriminator. Anything else
# is INDETERMINATE and exits 2 — a caller that cannot tell must never
# claim the artifact landed (fail closed).
#
# jq is deliberately NOT used: the field extraction runs inside gh's own
# `--jq`, so this script carries no system-jq dependency (same reasoning
# as resolve-publish-run.sh).
#
# Every string interpolated into the envelope goes through
# json_escape, so a tag carrying a quote or a backslash emits valid
# JSON rather than a broken object (rules/script-delegation.md Script
# Requirements, "JSON-producing"). Each definitive-no branch also writes
# an actionable stderr diagnostic before exiting, per that rule's
# "self-error-handling" and rules/error-handling.md Actionable Messages.
#
# Usage: verify-github-release.sh <owner> <repo> <tag> <run-id>
# Out:   one JSON object on stdout —
#          rc 0: {"ok":true,"tag":"...","assets":N,"url":"...","run_conclusion":"success"}
#          rc 1: {"ok":false,"reason":"...","tag":"...","assets":N,"run_conclusion":"..."}
#        A diagnostic accompanies every non-zero exit on stderr. On exit
#        2 stdout is empty.
# Exit:  0 the run succeeded, the release is published, and every asset
#          is retrievable;
#        1 a definitive no (run conclusion not `success`, or the release
#          is absent, draft, empty, or carries an asset not in the
#          `uploaded` state);
#        2 indeterminate (gh absent or unreachable, run still in flight,
#          unparseable body) or a usage error
