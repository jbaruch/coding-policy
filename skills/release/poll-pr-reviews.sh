# `reviews.*.body` carries the full review body text — a review's state classifies

#                   "submitted_at": "ISO-8601|null", "body": "text|null",

#                   "stale": bool},

#                   "submitted_at": "ISO-8601|null", "body": "text|null",

#   }
#
# A review's `.state` is resolved AGAINST `head_sha`: a review whose
# `commit_id` is not the current head has not reviewed the current code, so
# its `.state` collapses to "none" (absent, not clean) and `.stale` is true —
# the rule in rules/review-severity.md / autonomous-shipping.md that a verdict
# approves only the commit it reviewed. The pre-resolution verdict stays
# visible in `submitted_at` / `body` / `commit_id` so a reader can tell "never
# reviewed" (state none, stale false) from "reviewed an older commit" (state
# none, stale true). Binding both symptoms to head fixes them together: a
# stale CHANGES_REQUESTED no longer false-reds a fix no reviewer has seen, and
# a stale COMMENTED/APPROVED no longer false-readies unreviewed code (#186).
#
# `merge_state.status == "DIRTY"` / `mergeable == "CONFLICTING"` means GitHub
# couldn't create `refs/pull/N/merge` and silently skipped `pull_request:`
# workflows — agent should surface a rebase recommendation rather than keep
# polling `ci.status: none`.

# Bot logins, by surface. A reviewer does NOT necessarily author its reviews
# and its inline comments under the same login, and the policy reviewer's login
# depends on WHICH repo the PR is in:
#
#   surface          Policy reviewer                       Copilot
#   ---------------  ------------------------------------  ----------------------------------
#   review           github-actions[bot] (coding-policy's  copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]
#                    own PRs) OR
#                    coding-policy-fleet-reviewer[bot]
#                    (consumer repos)
#   inline comment   same login as its review              Copilot
#
# The policy reviewer runs two ways: in coding-policy itself as a GitHub Actions
# workflow (review-codex.yml, Codex CLI) submitting with the workflow's
# GITHUB_TOKEN, so its author is `github-actions[bot]`; in every consumer repo as
# the central fleet App (coding-policy#202), submitting as
# `coding-policy-fleet-reviewer[bot]`. A given PR is reviewed by exactly one of
# them today, so the watcher must resolve the policy reviewer across BOTH logins
# — one that only knew `github-actions[bot]` sat blind at `none` on every
# consumer PR the fleet App reviewed. `latest_review_by` aggregates fail-safe
# (each login's own latest, CHANGES_REQUESTED wins) so a hypothetical both-logins
# PR can never mask an active block.
#
# Counting Copilot's comments against its REVIEW login matches nothing, so
# `inline_comments.copilot` reads 0 on every PR — which vacuously satisfies the
# release skill's Step 7 "every inline comment has a reply" merge gate and lets
# a real Copilot finding merge unanswered. Comment counting therefore matches a
# SET of logins per reviewer. A comment carries exactly one author, so listing
# multiple logins cannot double-count.

# `--paginate` is mandatory: GitHub's default per-page is 30, and a PR
# with more than that many reviews/comments would otherwise return only
# the first page. The script's `last` filter would then pick the last
# entry on page 1 — not the actual latest review — and the gate could
# approve a merge against stale data. `--jq` is incompatible with
# `--paginate` here (it applies per page, not across the stream), so
# pipe the raw paginated output through `jq -s 'add | ...'` to slurp
# every page into one array before filtering. `per_page=100` is the API
# maximum and keeps request volume bounded.
# Variadic on login so one reviewer's multiple identities collapse to a single
# verdict — the policy reviewer is `github-actions[bot]` on coding-policy's own
# PRs and `coding-policy-fleet-reviewer[bot]` on consumer repos (see the login
# table above). A given PR carries reviews from only one of them today, but this
# is a MERGE GATE: aggregate fail-safe rather than assume. Take each login's
# OWN latest review, then if ANY of those is CHANGES_REQUESTED surface that
# (an active block from one identity must never be masked by a later clean
# review from another); otherwise surface the newest among them.
