# Wait for one worker's standup answer, with the standup's own give-up budget.
#
# A standup answer is four lines, not a task, so the wait for it is short. The
# budget is THIS script's constant, never a number the skill picks per run
# (rules/script-as-black-box.md, rules/ci-safety.md Always Watch CI); the
# skill invokes this wrapper and nothing else. Everything besides the budget —
# the two-signal completion (report file on disk AND the `REPORT: ` marker in
# the pane), the poll interval, the exit codes — belongs to wait-report.sh in
# the sibling herdr-teamlead skill, which this script execs.
#
# Contract:
#   argv  : <agent-name> <report-path>   forwarded verbatim to wait-report.sh
#   stdout: wait-report.sh's one JSON object.
#   stderr: diagnostics.
#   exit  : wait-report.sh's code — 0 report found, 1 budget exhausted,
#           2 usage error or tool failure, 3 blocked at a dialog, 4 file
#           present but marker unconfirmed (read the pane); also 2 when
#           wait-report.sh is not installed beside this skill or the budget
#           override is not an integer. In both of those cases nothing is run.
#   env   : STANDUP_WAIT_BUDGET_SEC overrides the budget (tests, a slow fleet).
#           HERDR_ENV and HERDR_BIN pass through to wait-report.sh.
