#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Ask one worker for its standup, as a plain message.
#
# The prompt is fixed text, the reply shape is fixed, and the report path is
# the worker's only channel back — so the whole thing is one deterministic
# send (`rules/script-delegation.md`). What the lead does with the answers is
# the reasoning part, and that stays in the skill.
#
# The prompt goes out as a MESSAGE, never a slash command: a standup question
# is prose, and every slash-delivery quirk this fleet has hit (Grok reading a
# pasted `/usage` as chat, Codex swallowing the Enter behind its autocomplete)
# belongs to commands, not messages.
#
# Contract:
#   argv  : <agent-name> <report-path>
#           report-path must be absolute; the worker writes its four lines there.
#   stdout: one JSON object —
#           {"agent":"<n>","report_path":"<p>","state":"<s>","sent":true}
#   stderr: diagnostics only.
#   exit  : 0 the prompt was accepted by a worker that was idle or done,
#           1 precondition unmet (usage, relative or over-long path, not inside Herdr,
#             `herdr` or `jq` absent),
#           2 a herdr failure, or an unreadable `agent get` payload,
#           3 the worker is not idle or done — nothing was sent. A standup
#             never interrupts a turn (`rules/agent-team-operation.md`
#             Dispatch Safety).
#   env   : HERDR_BIN overrides the herdr binary; the tests point it at a fake.
#           STANDUP_REPORT_PATH_MAX_COLS overrides the report path length
#           limit; a non-integer or zero value is a precondition failure.
