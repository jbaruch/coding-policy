# Outcome-based tests for skills/teamlead/provision-worktree.sh.
#
# Real local git repos, driven offline: a bare "origin" plus a shared checkout
# cloned from it, per scenario, so the cases share no state and run in any
# order (rules/testing-standards.md Independence). WORKTREE_ROOT points at the
# temp dir so nothing lands in the operator's real ~/.worktrees.
#
# The harness drops `set -e` to aggregate results, so every fixture-setup
# command is checked explicitly and aborts with a fatal diagnostic on failure
# (rules/error-handling.md aggregate-reporting carve-out).
#
# Covers:
#   1. Create           -> a new branch cut from the base ref, state created.
#   2. Attach local     -> an existing local branch is checked out, not recut.
#   3. Attach remote    -> an origin branch is tracked.
#   4. Idempotent       -> a re-run on the same path/branch is a no-op.
#   5. Wrong branch     -> a path holding another branch is exit 2.
#   6. Occupied path    -> a non-worktree path is exit 2, left alone.
#   7. Bad branch name  -> exit 1 per ci-safety naming.
#   8. Outside the root -> exit 1, nothing created.
#   9. Not a repo       -> exit 1.
#  10. Usage            -> exit 1 with a usage line.
#  11. Foreign worktree -> a work tree of ANOTHER repo on the same branch name
#                          is refused, naming both git dirs. Same branch name
#                          is not identity; the shared object store is.
