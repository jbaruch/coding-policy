# Remove the worker worktrees and local branches a round left behind.
#
# Every Herdr round provisions worktrees under the worktree root
# (`provision-worktree.sh`) and the lead removes the task's own worktree after
# its merge (`rules/agent-worktree-isolation.md` Cleanup). Review, test and
# verify worktrees from earlier rounds, and the local branches a removed
# worktree leaves behind, accumulate until someone notices `git worktree list`
# scrolling. Which of them are safe to remove is one right answer per input,
# so the decision lives here (`rules/script-delegation.md`).
#
# Decision predicate — a worktree is REMOVED (and its branch deleted) iff:
#   * it is not the shared checkout itself,
#   * it lies under the worktree root,
#   * it is on a branch (not detached) other than origin's default branch,
#   * it is not locked,
#   * `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` is empty — untracked
#     files count as dirty whatever `status.showUntrackedFiles` says;
#     ignored files do not, they are reproducible by the ignore's own claim
#     and `git worktree remove` treats them the same way,
#   * its branch is an ancestor of origin's default branch (fully merged),
#     judged against refs fetched by THIS run and origin's default branch as
#     re-queried by THIS run — a fetch or default-branch lookup that fails is
#     a precondition failure, never a judgment from stale refs.
# A local branch with no worktree is DELETED iff it is not the default branch
# and is an ancestor of origin's default branch. That ancestry check is the
# safety, and it judges a captured commit rather than a name that can move.
# Deletion is then `git update-ref -d refs/heads/<branch> <that commit>`,
# git's compare-and-delete: it removes the branch only while it still points
# at the commit just proved merged, so a commit landing mid-run keeps the
# branch instead of being force-deleted. `branch -d` would re-derive the
# safety against the local default, which may lag origin's, and `branch -D`
# would skip it entirely; neither is atomic with the check. Removal is `git worktree remove`,
# never `rm -rf`. Everything else is KEPT and reported with its reason. Stale
# worktree metadata is pruned (`git worktree prune --expire now`) after every
# worktree decision and before the branch pass, so a confirmed-gone entry's
# merged branch goes in the same run; the prune is skipped when any worktree
# could not be entered, since git would read an unreadable directory as gone
# and drop its entry. Nothing here
# pushes to origin; a dry run still fetches (without --prune), reads origin's
# default branch with `ls-remote --symref` instead of rewriting origin/HEAD,
# and skips the metadata prune, so its decisions are current and .git is
# otherwise untouched.
#
# Contract:
#   argv  : <shared-checkout> [--dry-run]
#           --dry-run reports the same decisions and removes nothing. It still
#           fetches, so its answer is current: remote-tracking refs and
#           FETCH_HEAD move, nothing else in .git does.

#   stderr: diagnostics only.
#   exit  : 0 every decision applied (or previewed),
#           1 precondition unmet (usage, git or python3 absent, not a repo,
#             no origin, fetch failed, default branch unresolvable, worktree
#             or branch inventory unreadable) — no JSON, nothing decided,
#           2 at least one check, removal or deletion failed; the rest still
#             ran and `failed` names each one.
#   env   : WORKTREE_ROOT overrides the worktree root (default
