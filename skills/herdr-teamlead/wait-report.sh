# Wait for one worker's round report to land, then report what was observed.
#
# Completion is TWO signals, never one: the report FILE exists on disk AND the
# worker's pane shows the `REPORT: ` marker line its brief ends with, carrying
# THIS report's exact absolute path on one unquoted, unfenced row. Known native
# decoration requires completed source-message proof; the source and display
# contracts live in teamlead/report_delivery.py. Each attempt uses a fresh
# report path, checked at brief composition. Herdr's
# lifecycle state alone does not decide it — a Claude Code pane reports `done`
# between tool calls while the turn is still running, and a Grok pane reports
# `working` while idle at startup, so a single idle/done observation would end
# the wait on a worker that has produced nothing.
#
# Contract:
#   argv  : [--once] [--worktree <path>] [--since <iso8601>] <agent-name> <report-path>
#           --worktree names the worker's own checkout. With it, a budget
#                  exhaustion classifies what the worker left behind and the
#                  JSON carries a "stall" object; without it the exhaustion
#                  reports the wait alone. The classification NEVER decides
#                  that the work is usable -- a stalled worker's output is
#                  unreviewed by construction (#418).
#           --since names when this dispatch was sent, from the ledger. A
#                  checkpoint (`--once`) carries no elapsed time of its own, so
#                  without it repeated checkpoints reset the clock and the
#                  stall outcome is never reached. With it the SAME
#                  script-owned budget applies, measured from the send (#418).
#           --once checks current evidence without waiting for future work.
#                  Existing blocked/refusal confirmations still run. A present
#                  unconfirmed report gets the normal consecutive-read check.
#                  With --once, exit 1 means a pending checkpoint.
#           agent-name  a live Herdr agent name (or the pane id hosting it).
#           report-path absolute path the brief told that worker to write; a
#                       relative path is refused (exit 2).
#   stdout: one JSON object on every terminal outcome except exit 2, which
#           leaves stdout empty (its diagnostic is on stderr) —
#           {"agent":"<n>","state":"<s>","report_path":"<p>",
#            "found":<bool>,"elapsed_seconds":<int>}
#           plus "reason":"<why>" on exits 4 and 5.
#   stderr: diagnostics and per-attempt progress.
#   exit  : 0 report found (`found` true),
#           1 pending checkpoint with --once; otherwise wait budget exhausted
#             (`found` false, `state` last observed). A budget exhaustion with
#             the report absent and the worker terminal is a STALL: the wait
#             ends rather than continuing, and the JSON adds
#             {"stall":{"class":"<c>","evidence":{...}}}. Without --worktree
#             class is `unclassified`; with it, class is
#             partial_work (a worktree mid-operation, staged, modified or
#             carrying untracked files -- preserve it as evidence),
#             unpushed_commits (completed work with a failed transport; the
#             dispatch-recovery path), no_work (clean and unchanged; the
#             dispatch is a not_sent-equivalent and may be retried), or
#             unknown (the worktree could not be read). Never commit a stalled
#             worker's partial work: re-dispatch it with the observed state
#             described, or discard it,
#           2 usage error, precondition unmet, or a herdr/tool failure,
#           3 the worker is blocked at an approval or question dialog,
#             confirmed by two reads and the pane
#             (`found` false) — inspect the dialog with
#             `herdr agent read <name> --source visible` before answering it,
#           4 the report FILE is present and the worker has read idle or done
#             on consecutive polls, yet the marker could not be confirmed
#             (`found` false, `reason` set) — never delivery: a marker the
#             pane wrapped cannot be told from a newline. The skill re-runs
#             for a blocked or working worker. Owner recover-report can append
#             source-evidenced delivery for a completed affected dispatch;
#             otherwise it records no report. Old receipts stay unchanged.
#           5 this attempt's report is unavailable after a terminal provider
#             refusal: two idle/done observations in the same pane, with an
#             unchanged terminal notice directly above an empty composer at
#             the live bottom of the same terminal session, and
#             no report file (`found` false, `reason` terminal_provider_refusal).
#             Save this JSON and record it with `teamlead record-refusal`;
#             never rephrase or synthesize the missing report. The bounded
#             move to another provider is dispatch-recovery.md's Wait
