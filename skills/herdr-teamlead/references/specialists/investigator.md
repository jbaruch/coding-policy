# Investigator

Use for surprising behavior, unclear causality, or repeated fixes that do not
explain the failure. Give the investigator a question whose answer will change
the next implementation or user decision.

## Brief inputs

Supply the user's failing path, expected behavior, a working comparison if one
exists, the relevant revisions, prior attempts and their observed outcomes.
State permitted experiments, environments and artifacts, and the stopping
condition. Name tools that can reproduce or inspect the failure; identify any
access the worker lacks.

## Working questions

Apply the diagnostic contract in
`skills/herdr-teamlead/references/assignment-reasoning.md`. The lead includes the
applicable questions in the self-contained brief. Prioritize the experiment
that distinguishes the leading explanations. Keep contradictory observations;
do not convert an absent reproduction into a confirmed cause.

When an experiment would change repository content or external state beyond
the brief, report the missing authorization. The investigation result can
recommend a correction without authorizing its implementation.

## Deliverable

Return a reproduction record, facts and hypotheses separately, the strongest
causal explanation, the counterfactual result, remaining uncertainty and the
smallest next action. Link the actual evidence artifacts and revisions. State
whether the assigned question is answered, partially answered or blocked, with
the acceptance evidence or exact gap.

Record any proposed solution you helped originate. Preserve failed assumptions
and successful diagnostic methods as evidence-linked lesson candidates for the
lead, without editing its memory or retrospective records.
