  team, balance worker usage, collect reports, run or retrieve retrospectives,
  catch up on outstanding user attention, curate team lessons, or save and resume
  lead handoffs. Live rounds require HERDR_ENV; saved memory and attention work

# Herdr Team Lead Skill

Process steps in order. Do not skip ahead.

Before any finish with enrolled work, reconcile the whole fleet under
`references/supervision.md`. Continue observation or persist an authorized pause
or handoff covering every active assignment. Keep user attention visible under
`references/attention.md`.

Follow `rules/agent-team-operation.md` for round constraints.

Each command resolves `CP` to the local or home plugin. Repeat its resolver in
every call. Prose `skills/...` paths are relative to that root.

## Step 1 — Determine the Mode

Three request kinds are answered offline, need no live Herdr, and finish here
after the requested operation. Each reference carries its own owner commands and
their contracts. Use the recorded state override or default, report any non-zero
diagnostic, and never fabricate missing history. They grant no new task
authority.

- **Catch-up or saved attention** — `references/attention.md`. Read all
  attention pages before claiming completeness.
- **Lesson curation, saved lead context, or a lead handoff** —
  `references/working-memory.md`.
- **A saved retrospective** — `references/retrospectives.md`. Report the note's
  date, coverage, conclusions, and path.

For every other request, read `HERDR_ENV` before running scripts.

- **Unset or empty** — this skill does not apply. Say so and do the task
  directly, without roster calls, briefs, provisioning, reports, or simulated
  worker roles. Finish here.
- **Set, with a team task or new retrospective** — proceed immediately to Step 2.
- **Set, with a single edit, question, lookup, or existing-code review** — do
  it directly. Finish here.

## Step 2 — Verify Herdr and the Roster

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/roster.sh"
```

Emits the caller and live workers with kind, pane, and state.

- **Exit 0, agents present** — proceed to Step 3.
- **Exit 0, empty roster** — report unnamed panes from `herdr agent list` and
  the correcting `herdr agent rename <pane-id> <name>` command. Finish here.
- **Exit 1 or 2** — report the diagnostic verbatim and finish here.

Record staffing gaps under `references/round-setup.md`. Leave unused specialist
profiles unlaunched. Never duplicate targets or fold verification onto a contributor.
Start workers in YOLO mode under `references/model-tiers.md`; preserve it on
relaunch. Verify live permission flags before dispatch, including existing workers.

## Step 3 — Verify Authority for the Repo

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/verify-authority.sh" <owner/repo>
```

Record the emitted namespace ownership evidence using Step 3 of
`references/round-setup.md`. For a non-owned repo, reuse explicit per-action
operator permission; absent permission, remain read-only or finish here.
On non-zero, report the diagnostic and finish here.

Record task authorization and permitted actions under the round-setup reference.
Create or resume the stable ledger under `references/task-ledger.md`; record its
absolute path before dispatch. Apply the round-setup accepted-behavior, resume
and supervision binding requirements.
Proceed immediately to Step 4.

## Step 4 — Measure Headroom

Run `references/retrospectives.md` on resume, before planning, or for an explicit
retrospective request. For an explicit request, complete a new retrospective and
finish here; otherwise continue below.

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/teamlead.sh" measure
```

Emits and saves headroom, windows, state, `tier_billing`, and `failed_agents`.
Busy workers are skipped. Unmeasured billing stays `unknown`. Report failed
measurements and obtain their readings before relying on those seats.

Usage and `--trace` contracts:

```text
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/round-setup.md
```

Proceed immediately to Step 5 once the required readings are available.

## Step 5 — Plan the Roles

Choose the responsibilities needed next under `references/specialists.md`.
Supply its requirements file for specialized work. Keep the developer reserved
through early fixes; schedule consultation and verification as the task needs them.

The composition triggers decide part of that roster. Classify this round
against the repo's declaration first. For a pre-implementation round, pass
`--planned` naming the surfaces the work will touch. A round with work already
written classifies that work:

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/teamlead.sh" detect-triggers \
  --repo <repo-path> --base <recorded-base> [--head <pushed-head>] \
  --roles <role[,role...]> [--requirements <requirements.json>] \
  [--planned <planned.json>] [--decisions <decisions.json>]
```

Exit 0 means every fired trigger is staffed or answered. On exit 1, read the
stderr object: an absent declaration is written first (`references/specialists.md`),
and an `unaddressed_trigger` is staffed in the roles below or answered by a
recorded decision with its reason. Re-run the command with the updated
declaration, roles, requirements and decisions after every such change, and
plan only once it exits 0.

A round that will split its review surface validates the partition first, then
plans it with `--partition`:

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/teamlead.sh" validate-partition \
  --repo <repo-path> --base <recorded-base> [--head <pushed-head>] \
  --partition <partition.json>
```

Exit 1 names every unowned path, every overlap and every slice owning nothing,
in one run. Fix the partition and re-run; plan only once it exits 0. Save its
stdout — `--partition` takes that result, never the document. Format, ownership
payload and the seating it produces:

```text
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/review-partition.md
```

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/teamlead.sh" plan \
  --roles <role[,role...]> [--requirements <requirements.json>] \
  [--exclude <role>=<agent>[,<agent>...]]... [--partition <partition.json>] \
  [--judge-mode adjudication|diagnosis] \
  [--round <role>=<round-type>] [--round-context <evidence.json>] \
  --task <task-id> [--fix-round <N>] [--correction-plan <id> --work <work.json>]
```

Emits the role plan without worker contact; a partitioned role is seated once
per slice as `<role>#<slice>`, and Step 10 dispatches each seat with its own
brief. A judge seat declares its mode:
`adjudication` rules on a contested verdict, `diagnosis` on the investigator's
assessment at an exhausted allowance. Pass the same `--judge-mode` to `apply`.
On exit 1, resolve the diagnostic before continuing. Apply the Step 5 constraints in `references/round-setup.md`:
exclude contributors from verification, reserve the developer through early fixes,
preserve task identity and fix count, and reuse recorded correction bounds.
Tier and qualification contracts:

```text
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/model-tiers.md
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/dispatch-recovery.md
```

`--preview-tiers` authorizes no dispatch. Save the plan and rationale.
Proceed immediately to Step 6.

## Step 6 — Build the Review Package

For reviewer/tester briefs, run from a checkout holding the recorded commits:

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/review-package.sh" \
  <recorded-base-sha> <pushed-head-sha> <round-reports-dir>/review-<base7>..<head7>.diff
```

Apply the Step 6 base, range, and rebuild requirements in
`references/round-setup.md`. Success prints the absolute review-package path;
set it as `REVIEW_PACKAGE`. On non-zero, fix the diagnostic and retry before
composing verification briefs. Other roles need no package.
Proceed immediately to Step 7.

## Step 7 — Compose the Briefs

Resolve policy paths through the Step 7 reference first. Write its outputs in
`shared` within `{"shared": {...}, "roles": {"<role>": {...}}}` and run:

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/compose-briefs.sh" \
  "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/templates" \
  <values.json> <round-reports-dir>
```

Emits common and role-brief paths. On non-zero, fix the diagnostic before
dispatch. Validates composition inputs and review evidence before writing.
Use a fresh absolute report path per role and attempt.

Follow `references/round-setup.md` Step 7 for shared and role-specific values,
authority, review evidence and brief completeness.
Proceed immediately to Step 8.

## Step 8 — Provision the Worktrees

Prune first, every round:

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/prune-worktrees.sh" <shared-checkout>
```

Emits the worktrees and branches removed, each kept one with its reason, and
`failed`; exit 2 lists every check or removal git refused. Exit 1 decided
nothing: fix its diagnostic and re-run before provisioning. Report every kept
`dirty`, `unmerged`, `locked` and `detached` entry to the operator; never
remove them by hand.

Then run once per writing worker and every worktree named in a brief:

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/provision-worktree.sh" \
  <shared-checkout> <branch> <worktree-path> [base-ref]
```

Emits path, branch, base, and `created|attached|already-provisioned`. On any
non-zero exit, fix the diagnostic and retry. Never dispatch a missing
worktree. Read-only consultations need none. Clean up after merge per
`rules/agent-worktree-isolation.md`. Proceed immediately to Step 9.

## Step 9 — Label the Layout

Optional, once per team; skip an already named sidebar.

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/label-workspaces.sh" \
  <lead-label> [<agent>=<workspace-id>]...
```

Emits per-target `renamed|unchanged|failed`; exit 3 names partial failures.
Report label failures and continue. Proceed immediately to Step 10.

## Step 10 — Dispatch the Briefs

Complete the retrospective reference's cadence and transition checks before live
dispatch. Apply rechecks coverage before worker input. Dry runs prove no coverage.

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/teamlead.sh" apply \
  --assignments <plan-file> \
  --brief <role>=<path> [--brief <role>=<path>]... \
  --report <role>=<report> [--report <role>=<report>]... \
  --common <path-to-COMMON.md> --task <task-id> \
  [--fix-round <N>] [--retain-context | --retain-specialist | --no-clear] \
  [--correction-plan <id> --work <work.json>] [--dispatch-id <stable-id>]
```

Emits dispatch JSON under `state-schema.md`. Supply each role's fresh absolute
report path from its brief. Apply enrolls before input; unknown sends remain
observation obligations. Apply refuses while an open decision or blocker on the
task is unanswered; see the attention reference's Dispatch gate.
Classify every brief against Step 3's authorization before sending it.
Append the dispatch outcome to the task ledger; `applied` proves dispatch only.

Apply the recovery reference's Dispatch context requirements before sending.
Preserve task identity and cumulative fix count. Retained fixes dispatch
developer alone. Warm consultations use the recovery reference's
`--retain-specialist` path. Reconcile unknown outcomes
before retrying. Reuse existing correction authorization within its bounds.

Follow the Dispatch Results contract in `references/round-flow.md` for busy,
uncertain, failed, and dry-run outcomes. Preserve all already enrolled work.

Dispatch references:

```text
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/dispatch-recovery.md
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/model-tiers.md
```

Proceed to Step 11.

## Step 11 — Observe the Fleet

Run the bounded foreground watcher for all enrolled assignments:

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/teamlead.sh" supervision-watch [--state <state-file>]
```

Retain and await its real execution handle. The JSON result gives `reason`,
`through`, and durable `events`; a quiet deadline completes only that checkpoint.
For each event or pending recheck, verify report delivery:

```bash
CP=.tessl/plugins/jbaruch/coding-policy; [ -d "$CP" ] || CP="$HOME/$CP"
bash "$CP/skills/herdr-teamlead/wait-report.sh" --once \
  [--worktree <worker-checkout>] [--base <dispatch-base>] \
  [--since <dispatch-sent-at>] <agent-name> <report-path>
```

The checkpoint emits delivery JSON; exit 2 emits only stderr. Exit 0 confirms
delivery, 1 remains pending, 3 confirms blocked, 4 lacks confirmed delivery, and
5 proves terminal refusal; record it with `record-refusal`. Read delivered
reports in full. Pass this dispatch's recorded send time as `--since`, its
recorded base as `--base`, and the worker's checkout as `--worktree`. An exit 1
then carries either `reason: checkpoint_pending` or a `stall` object; act on a
stall under `rules/agent-team-operation.md` Stalled Workers and record the
obligation through `references/attention.md`. Preserve the blocked/refusal and native-recovery paths in the
following references; never re-dispatch over uncertainty or resend a refused
brief to its provider.

```text
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/supervision.md
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/dispatch-recovery.md
```

Save a consultation's successful delivery receipt and record `assess-specialist`
under `references/specialists.md` before retiring its enrollment.

Record each outcome in the task ledger and user-facing obligations in the
attention queue. Acknowledge only handled event IDs through the saved snapshot;
schedule pending rechecks. Resolve enrollment only after recording its assessed
outcome, separately from assignment acceptance and task completion. Complete due
retrospectives between checkpoints without interrupting workers. Resume the fleet
watch while any observation obligation remains; one blocked worker never hides
another worker's report. Proceed to Step 12 when the required reports are delivered
or their unavailability and recovery are recorded.

## Step 12 — Gate the Round

Read every report file in full, including a report whose worker exited cleanly.
A `## BLOCKED` section can sit under a report that otherwise reads as finished.
Classify each finding blocking or advisory per `rules/review-severity.md`.
Record assignment acceptance or outstanding work in the task ledger against
the inspected report and artifact evidence. Record the task's gate decision
separately; a worker finishing its brief never completes the whole task.
Assess correction scope and bug evidence under `references/assignment-reasoning.md`.
Persist user-facing obligations under `references/attention.md` before presenting
them; record an actual answer or resolution separately from showing the item.

After accepting a consultation, return to Step 4 for the next needed
responsibility. For an investigation-only task, use the knowledge gate below.

For an investigation-only task, assess every assigned report against the requested
knowledge deliverable. Resolve blocking findings through the same bounded and
judge paths below. Once its criteria hold, present the findings and preserve open
user decisions; proceed to Step 15 if a task worktree needs cleanup, otherwise
Step 16. No implementation or release is inferred from the diagnostic result.

- **Any blocking finding** — apply the round-flow reference's Blocking Gate
  contract and `rules/agent-team-operation.md` Fix Loops. Return to Step 4 for
  an authorized correction or Step 13 for a required judge ruling. At an
  exhausted allowance, record the checkpoint through
  `references/dispatch-recovery.md`, consult the investigator under
  `references/specialists.md`, and take its assessed report to Step 13 for the
  diagnosis; no operator decision is awaited.
- **Advisory findings only** — record them in the round log and fold them into
  the next round that is already happening. Never spend a round on a lone
  advisory.

Apply the release gate in this reference; obtain broad independent reviewer and
tester passes against the current pushed tip before release:

```text
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/round-flow.md
```

With its release criteria met, proceed immediately to Step 13.

## Step 13 — Run the Judge Round

Optional. No trigger — proceed to Step 14. A bot disagreement inside Step 14
returns here first.

Run the round's seven steps in order — compose the brief, re-measure the shared
window, plan the pinned seat, start its worker on the pinned tier, dispatch,
wait, act on the ruling:

```text
skills/herdr-teamlead/references/judge-round.md
```

The judge is read-only, so Step 8 is skipped for it. Never substitute a judge,
lower its tier, or hand-write an assignment to bypass a refusal. Its last step
names where to continue.

## Step 14 — Release the Pull Request

The release is one more assignment, never a prompt into the developer's
existing context. Return to Step 7 with the role `release` for
the developer's agent (template `templates/brief-release.md`, the same
`WORKTREE` and `BRANCH`, a fresh `REPORT`), run Step 8 (it reports
`already-provisioned`), dispatch through Step 10 so the context is cleared and
the brief is fresh, and wait on the report in Step 11. A source-changing
release finding returns to Step 12 for the next counted developer assignment.
The worker merges after all gates pass. Proceed immediately to Step 15 only
after verifying its reported release against the live VCS and release gates.
Record that evidence in the task ledger.

## Step 15 — Clean Up the Worktree

Fast-forward the shared checkout, remove the worktree, and delete the branch
per `rules/agent-worktree-isolation.md`, then run Step 8's prune script again
for the round's other worktrees. Proceed immediately to Step 16.

## Step 16 — Log the Round

Finalize the task ledger with the round outcome and remaining obligations.
Mark the task completed only after its acceptance criteria and required
release and cleanup obligations are verified. Preserve the ledger for resume
and standup. Preserve retrospective notes and link them from the ledger. Save
current progress through the attention owner and stow the lead's handoff under
the working-memory reference. Reconcile supervision before ending the turn.
Report outstanding attention first, followed by the outcome and saved paths.
Finish here.

For the daily standup, use
`Skill(skill: "herdr-standup")`.
