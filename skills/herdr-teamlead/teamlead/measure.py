"""Measure each agent's remaining subscription budget.

The flow per agent is always the same:

1. read live status with `herdr agent get` -- never trust the last snapshot
2. when herdr says `working`, confirm it against the pane (see teamlead/probe.py)
3. refuse to write to a `working` or `blocked` agent, always
4. send the agent's usage slash command by the mechanism its config names
   (see SLASH_DELIVERIES in teamlead/herdr.py -- the TUIs disagree), and
   confirm the composer consumed it (see teamlead/composer.py)
5. wait for its marker, `herdr pane wait-output` first and a bounded
   `herdr agent read` poll second
6. read the pane and parse it
7. close the dialog when the agent opens one -- always, including on failure

Step 5 has two mechanisms on purpose. `pane wait-output` is event-driven and
cheap, but it did not deliver against Grok's modal on the alternate screen,
while prompt-then-read is the sequence that works by hand. Neither is trusted
alone: the wait is best-effort, and the marker is confirmed in the text that
actually gets parsed.

Step 7 runs in a `finally`: a usage dialog left open flips the agent to
`working` and swallows the next prompt, so a failed read must not leave one
standing.

`measured_at` is passed in. Nothing in this module reads the clock: that is a
CLI-layer concern, which is what lets the tests assert on an exact timestamp.

    The marker is a literal substring, never a pattern, so the wait uses
    herdr's `--match` rather than `--regex`. An escaped regex is one more
    engine to be wrong about, and the config field is documented as literal
    text.

    Two mechanisms, tried in order, with the second covering the first:

    1. `herdr pane wait-output --match ...` -- event-driven, no sleeping.
    2. a bounded `herdr agent read` poll -- the prompt-then-read sequence that
       works by hand against a modal on the alternate screen.

    If neither finds the marker and the agent configures
    `dialog_next_tab_keys`, the dialog is tabbed through up to `max_tabs`
    times, re-reading each time: a multi-tab usage dialog may not open on the
    tab carrying the report.

    A failed wait is a warning, not the end: the marker is confirmed in the
    text that will actually be parsed. Raises HerdrError naming both
    mechanisms when the marker never appears.
