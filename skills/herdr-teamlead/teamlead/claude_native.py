"""Claude Code's completed-turn evidence, read from its own session transcript.

Claude Code appends JSONL to `<config>/projects/<slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`, one
row per API content block: rows sharing `message.id` are one assistant message
ordered by `apiBlockIndex`, and every row carrying a `uuid` links to the one
before it through `parentUuid`. Blocks of one message repeat that message's
`stop_reason`, which is null on a block written before the message settled.
Verified on Claude Code 2.1.263 under Herdr 0.8.2.

Nothing here reads rendered pane text. A completed final message is the last
main-chain assistant message: `end_turn`, built from text and thinking blocks
alone, with no user turn after it. Bookkeeping rows (`system`, `attachment`,
`mode`, `permission-mode`, `ai-title`, `last-prompt`, ...) carry no task, so
they neither complete nor reset a turn -- but a row that DECLARES itself a turn
is held to the turn contract even when it carries none of a turn's fields. A
user row that is not tool output is a new turn and ends the pending message.

Parallel tool calls come in two orderings, both from this same pinned CLI, and
which one appears depends on when the results are flushed:

* interleaved -- `tool_use` block, its `user` tool-result row, the next
  `tool_use` block of the SAME message, its result. Every row links to the one
  before it.
* queued -- both `tool_use` blocks, then both results. Claude Code links a
  result to the block row that REQUESTED it, so the first result's parent is
  not the row before it and the chain branches.

So a result names its requester in BOTH orderings -- verified on every one of
the 177 tool results across six preserved sessions -- and that is the rule:
a `tool_result` row links to the block row whose `tool_use` id it answers, in
the message being assembled, once. Every other row links to the row before it.
A broken parent chain, a parent naming an abandoned branch or a row that merely
occurred earlier, a mismatched or repeated tool result, a subagent row on the
main chain, a foreign session id, contradictory completion metadata, or an
unreadable shape stays unconfirmed.
