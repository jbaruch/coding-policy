"""Diff-time detection of the four non-exhaustion Team Composition triggers.

The exhaustion trigger is enforced in code: `recovery.require_investigation_before_judge`
refuses a judge dispatch at an exhausted allowance with no assessment. The
architect, security, UX-and-product and documentation triggers shipped as prose
alone (#408), so the operative rule was "the lead notices, or it does not
happen" -- the condition the triggers were written to replace. A trigger nobody
mechanically evaluates is a check nobody runs (`rules/language-diagnostics.md`).

This module is that evaluation. It reads the consuming repo's own declaration
of its trigger surfaces, classifies the task's diff against them, and refuses
the round when a fired trigger is neither staffed nor answered by a recorded
staffing decision. Every signal is mechanical: a package directory absent from
the base, a changed path in the declared trust-boundary set, an added line
carrying a declared CLI-surface marker, an added file in the declared
user-facing docs set.

The declaration is the repo's, never this module's. The architect trigger reads
"above the size the repo states", and a repo that states no size has a trigger
that fires never or always depending on the reader (#415), so
`package_change_lines` is required and a missing declaration is refused rather
than silently treated as "nothing fires".

Contract:

* `load_declaration(repo)` reads `<repo>/.herdr/triggers.json`.
* `detect(...)` is pure over the declaration and the diff facts.
* `run_command(args, runner=...)` collects those facts through `runner`, a
  callable taking a git argument list and returning its stdout.
* The payload lists every trigger with its evidence; the failure object names
  the fired triggers that are neither staffed nor decided.
