"""Verify that a slash command was actually consumed by the agent's composer.

Sending a command is not the same as the agent receiving one. Live, `herdr
agent prompt codex /new` pasted `/new` into Codex's composer, the
slash-autocomplete popup swallowed the Enter, and nothing submitted. `agent
wait --until idle` returned immediately -- the agent had been idle the whole
time -- so teamlead reported `cleared: true` and pasted the assignment on top
of the unsent text. Codex received `/newNew assignment from the team lead...`
and rejected it twice.

Every failure there was a missing check, not a bad send. So after every slash
command teamlead reads the pane's composer row and confirms the text is gone:

* still there -> press Enter once more, re-read
* still there after that -> fail the agent, and never send the assignment
* composer non-empty before a dispatch -> recover once, then re-read

The composer row is the last row starting with the agent's prompt glyph
(`› ` for Codex, `❯ ` for Claude, `│ ❯` for Grok). A glyph that is absent from
the read -- covered by a modal, scrolled away, or simply not configured --
means teamlead cannot see the composer, and an unverifiable composer is
treated as consumed rather than invented into a failure.
