"""The teamlead state file: usage snapshots and the assignment ledger.

State is a hint, not authority. A snapshot records what an agent's budget
looked like when it was measured; it never substitutes for reading the agent's
live status before writing to it. `plan` may run off a stale snapshot on
purpose (planning has no side effects); `apply` always re-checks live status.

Schema (schema_version 3)::

    {
      "schema_version": 3,
      "snapshots":  [ <measure output>, ... ],   # newest last, capped at 20
      "assignments":[ {"schema_version": 3, "at": <ISO-8601>,
                       "role": <str>, "agent": <str>,
                       "status": "applied" | "sent_but_not_started"
                                 | "unknown",
                       "cleared": <bool> | null,
                       "clear_reason": "automatic" | "hand" | "retained" | "unknown",
                       "task": <str> | null, "fix_round": <int> | null,
                       "context_session": <object> | null}, ... ]
    }

`status` records whether the hand-off was confirmed: `applied` counts toward
an agent's role history, `sent_but_not_started` does not (see
UNCOUNTED_STATUSES), and `unknown` marks a version-1 row migrated without the
information. Version 1 documents and rows carry no `status`; the 1 -> 2
migration below stamps them `unknown`.

Version 3 records context handling, the task and the fix-round number.
Version-2 history cannot prove those facts: migration stamps null values and
an unknown reason. Snapshot versions evolve independently of ledger versions.

Every RECORD carries its own `schema_version`, not just the document: a ledger
row outlives the document it arrived in, and a version on the row is what makes
a later migration auditable row by row.

teamlead owns this file and is the only writer. Writes are atomic: a temp file
in the same directory followed by `os.replace`, so an interrupted run leaves
the previous state intact rather than a truncated file.

Reading follows one rule per direction:

* **Older** document or record: the owner migrates it through MIGRATIONS and
  rewrites the upgraded file. Nobody else migrates.
* **Newer** document or record: this build is the lagging reader, not the
  migrator. It takes the no-usable-prior-state path -- an empty document in
  memory, the file left exactly as found, a warning on stderr.
* **Corrupt** file: no usable prior state, same treatment. Discarding a
  snapshot ring costs one re-measure; overwriting an unread file costs the
  ledger.
