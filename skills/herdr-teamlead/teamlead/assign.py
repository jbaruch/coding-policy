"""Hand a role and its brief to an agent.

The hard rule this module enforces: teamlead never types into an agent that is
`working` or `blocked`. Statuses are checked for *every* target before the
first keystroke is sent, so a run that is going to be refused sends nothing at
all rather than half the assignments.

`working` from herdr is confirmed against the pane first (see
teamlead/probe.py) -- herdr's title-derived state goes stale and would
otherwise refuse a genuinely idle agent forever. `blocked` is never probed.

The clear command (`/clear`, `/new`) goes out by whichever mechanism the
agent's config names -- see SLASH_DELIVERIES in teamlead/herdr.py, because the
TUIs disagree about what a pasted slash command means. The assignment itself
IS a message, so it always goes through `agent prompt`.

Both are gated on the composer being empty (see teamlead/composer.py). Live,
an unsent `/new` sat in Codex's composer and the assignment was pasted onto
the end of it, so Codex received `/newNew assignment from the team lead...`
and rejected it. The assignment is never sent to an agent whose composer still
holds text.

Sending it is not the end either. A leftover `/` turned an assignment into
`/New assignment ...`, Claude Code answered "Args from unknown skill", and no
turn ever started -- while teamlead reported the round applied. So each
hand-off is confirmed: the transcript must show the message, the runtime must
not have read it as a command, and the agent must leave idle. Anything less is
reported as `sent_but_not_started` rather than as success.

`--dry-run` builds the same argv lists the live path would execute (the
builders live on the transport) and prints them without running anything.
