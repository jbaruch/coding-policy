"""Verified worker starts and fresh-round relaunches.

Herdr 0.8.2's bundled schema names agent.start's {agent, argv} result and
pane.process_info's foreground process records. The installed CLI returns
JSON for both. Older builds without that contract fail before dispatch.
https://herdr.dev/docs/socket-api/

Relaunch terminates only the identified, idle foreground agent after an empty
composer check, waits for its shell, then starts the selected tier. It never
terminates a working/blocked agent or guesses a PID from a transcript.
