"""Deterministic role-to-agent assignment.

A pure function of (roles, snapshot, previous role counts, exclusions, cost
weights). Same inputs, same output, every time -- no clock, no filesystem, no
herdr. Planning never touches an agent.

Every role carries a cost weight: what one round in that seat is expected to
burn out of an agent's remaining budget. `developer` is the heaviest seat and
`reviewer` the lightest (DEFAULT_ROLE_COSTS), and an operator re-weighs any of
them with a `role_costs` map in config.json. Seats are filled heaviest first,
whatever order `--roles` arrives in, and each seat goes to the eligible agent
that leaves the round's minimum projected headroom highest -- the minimum
across the agents holding a seat, per `rules/agent-team-operation.md`
("Headroom is the minimum remaining window per worker, never the average").
An agent holding no seat burns nothing, so it is not part of that minimum.

`exclude` bars agents from a role, as `{role: [agent, ...]}`. Nobody reviews or
verifies the branch they wrote, so the lead bars the author from those seats. A
role whose eligible field is empty is a PlanError, never a silent drop.

Ordering within one role, in full:

1. Agents excluded from that role are not candidates at all, and neither is
   one whose pick would leave a later role with nobody eligible.
2. Agents with a known headroom sort before agents whose headroom is null
   (busy, unmeasured, or unparseable).
3. Known-headroom agents sort by the round's projected minimum the pick would
   leave, descending -- this candidate's headroom minus this seat's weight,
   floored by what the seats already filled projected.
4. A tie there sorts by the candidate's own projected headroom, descending.
   Once the floor binds, that is the agent with the most headroom left.
5. A remaining tie is broken toward the agent that has held *the role being
   assigned* the fewest times, which stops one agent from owning `developer`
   forever.
6. Any remaining tie is broken by agent name, ascending.
7. Null-headroom agents sort by name alone. They are the fallback pool, and
   the ledger has nothing useful to say about an agent nobody could measure.

`assignments` comes back keyed in the caller's `--roles` order; `rationale`
reads in the order the seats were filled, heaviest first, because the field a
pick chose from only makes sense in that order.
