# Compose one round's briefs from the packaged templates.

# Substitution is a pure function of (template, values), so it belongs in a
# script rather than in an agent's hands (`rules/script-delegation.md`): a
# placeholder the agent forgets to fill reaches a worker as the literal
# `{{WORKTREE}}`, and a worker with a cleared context has no way to notice.

# Contract:
#   argv  : <templates-dir> <values-json-file> <output-dir>
#   values: {"shared": {"KEY": "value", ...},
#            "roles":  {"<role>": {"KEY": "value", ...}, ...}}
#           `shared` fills COMMON.md and every brief; a role's own values win
#           on a collision. Roles map to `brief-<role>.md` in the templates dir.
#   stdout: one JSON object —
#           {"common":"<path>","briefs":{"<role>":"<path>", ...}}
#   stderr: diagnostics only.
#   exit  : 0 every file written with no placeholder left,
#           1 precondition unmet (usage, missing dir/file/template, no jq),
#           2 validation failed — an unfilled placeholder, a supplied key no
#             template uses, a value that is not text, or a REPORT longer
#             than TEAMLEAD_REPORT_PATH_MAX_COLS. Nothing is written on a
#             validation failure,
#           3 a tool this depends on failed (the placeholder scan itself). The
#             answer is unknown, which is never reported as "no placeholders".
#   env   : TEAMLEAD_REPORT_PATH_MAX_COLS overrides the REPORT length limit
#           (tests, a fleet whose narrowest pane is wider); a non-integer or
#           zero value is a precondition failure (exit 1).
#
# Validation runs in both directions on purpose. An unfilled placeholder is a
# brief that lies to a worker; a supplied key nothing uses is a value the lead
# believes it sent and did not.
