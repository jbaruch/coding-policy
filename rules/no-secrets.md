# No Secrets

## Never Commit Secrets

- Never commit API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, or `.env` files
- This includes test/development credentials — they tend to leak into production
- If a secret was committed, rotate it immediately — removing the commit is not enough

## Use Environment Variables or Secrets Managers

- Read secrets from environment variables or a secrets manager at runtime
- Never hardcode credentials in source code, config files, or scripts

## Document Required Variables

- Maintain a `.env.example` file listing every required environment variable with placeholder values
- Document what each variable is for and where to get the value

## Pre-commit Scanning

- Use pre-commit hooks for secret scanning (e.g., detect-secrets, gitleaks, trufflehog)
- Block commits that contain patterns matching secrets

## Logging

- **Never log secrets** — not at any log level, not in error messages, not in stack traces
- Sanitize or redact sensitive values before they reach any logging or monitoring system
