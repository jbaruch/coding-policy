# Warn at session start when installed Tessl plugins are behind the registry.
#
# A SessionStart hook: runs `tessl outdated --json`, and if anything is behind,
# injects a short notice via additionalContext so the agent/user sees it and can
# `tessl update`. Fleet repos silently drift to stale policy versions with
# nothing flagging it (observed: consumers running an old coding-policy while a
# newer one is published); this surfaces that the moment a session opens.
#
# Design choices, learned from the reverted resurface hook:
#   - It DOES something (checks registry state), it does not re-state a rule.
#   - SessionStart fires once per session, not per turn — no per-turn fleet tax.
#   - Throttled: a registry check runs at most once per FRESHNESS_THROTTLE_HOURS
#     (default 24h) across sessions, so most session starts skip the network call.
#   - Informative only. Never blocks (always exits 0), never exits 2.
#
# Contract:
#   stdin : consensus SessionStart JSON — not read (the script needs none of it).
#   stdout: when the registry check runs, one JSON object
#           {"additionalContext": "<status>"} whose text begins with the
#           "Session-start status — " marker (rules/hook-action-reporting.md) —
#           "policy: fresh" (success) or the available updates (a header plus one
#           line per plugin). Throttled and tool-missing sessions stay silent.
#   exit  : always 0. Every best-effort failure emits an actionable stderr warning
#           and continues/no-ops (rules/error-handling.md Shell Error Handling).
#   state : $FRESHNESS_STATE_DIR/last-check (default ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/coding-policy-freshness),
#           a throttle stamp. Schema documented in hooks/state-schema.md:
#           one line "<schema_version> <checked_at>".
#   env   : FRESHNESS_THROTTLE_HOURS (default 24), FRESHNESS_STATE_DIR (tests),
#           FRESHNESS_NOW (test-only injected clock; defaults to `date +%s`).
