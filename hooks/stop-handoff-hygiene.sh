# Flag leftover local hygiene before the agent hands off (a Stop gate).
#
# A Claude Code `Stop` hook: at handoff it runs deterministic, universal
# git-hygiene checks and, when it finds clearly-actionable leftovers, blocks the
# stop once with an actionable reason so the agent can clean up. We hand-cleaned
# exactly this mess in real sessions — stray merged-and-remote-deleted local
# branches and an abandoned worktree. This mechanizes the pre-handoff cleanup
# rules/language-diagnostics.md endorses ("a Stop or pre-handoff hook running the
# gate mechanizes this") and complements the fleet-wide delete_branch_on_merge
# (that auto-cleans REMOTE branches; this covers the LOCAL branches/worktrees it
# never touches).
#
# Why nativeHooks (not the portable `hooks` tier): blocking a stop is an
# agent-specific contract with no portable consensus form — the `hooks` tier
# wraps the script in `tessl hook run`, which translates `additionalContext`
# (informational), not a stop-block. nativeHooks writes the entry raw to each
# agent's native config, so the agent reads the script's `{"decision":"block"}`
# directly. Claude Code and Codex share the same Stop contract (decision/reason/
# stop_hook_active), so the SAME script is dual-wired. The two entries differ in
# shape by necessity: Claude Code's config takes command + args[], Codex's takes
# a single command string (its config has no args field), so nativeHooks.codex
# uses `bash "<path>"` as one string. Verified by installing into scratch
# consumers and inspecting .claude/settings.json and .codex/config.toml.
#
# Blocking findings (gate the stop, once):
#   - Leftover local branches whose upstream is gone (merged then remote-deleted).
#   - Orphaned linked worktrees whose branch's upstream is gone.
#   - Diagnostics findings in the CHANGED set only (uncommitted .sh/.py):
#     lint the .sh with shellcheck, the .py with pyright. Skipped when nothing
#     lintable changed, so a clean handoff costs nothing. An absent engine is
#     blocking (the gate can't clear findings without it) — install and re-check.
#     Inlined here rather than delegated to scripts/run-diagnostics.sh, which the
#     Tessl packer does not ship (only rules/, skills/, hooks/ surfaces publish).
# Report-only (never blocks on its own): a dirty working tree — often intentional
#   work-in-progress, surfaced to the user but not trapped.
#
# Loop-safe: reads `stop_hook_active` from stdin and allows immediately when set,
# so it blocks at most once per handoff chain — never traps the agent in a loop.
# Fail-open: any inability to evaluate (no jq, not a git repo, parse failure)
# allows the stop. A hygiene nudge must never wedge a handoff.
#
# Contract:
#   stdin : Claude Code Stop JSON. Only `.stop_hook_active` is read.
#   stdout: on a block, one JSON object {"decision":"block","reason":"<text>"};
#           otherwise nothing.
#   exit  : always 0 (block is expressed in stdout JSON, never via exit code).
#           Best-effort failures warn to stderr and allow the stop.
#   state : none — every check reads live git state.

# Is this session a Herdr WORKER rather than the lead?
#
# The team rules reserve the shared checkout and every worktree operation for
# the lead: a worker "runs no git command against the shared checkout,
# mutating or otherwise" and "never creates, moves, or removes a worktree"
# (rules/agent-team-operation.md Writers and Checkouts). A hook that tells a
# worker to fast-forward `main` or remove a worktree is instructing it to
# break that rule -- which is exactly what happened in a live round, where the
# worker reported the contradiction and then obeyed the hook.
#
# Herdr exports no lead/worker flag, so the role is derived from where the
# session sits: the lead works in the shared checkout, every worker works in a
# linked worktree. In a linked worktree `--git-dir` and `--git-common-dir`
# resolve differently; in the main checkout they are the same.
#
# 0 = a Herdr worker (suppress lead-only advice), 1 = the lead, a standalone
# agent, or anything this cannot determine. Fail open: a hook that goes silent
# because a git command failed would be worse than one that speaks up.
