#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Report the live Herdr team at session start.
#
# A SessionStart hook for the lead's own pane: when this session runs inside
# Herdr alongside other NAMED agents, it names them and their lifecycle state
# so the lead opens knowing who is on the roster and who is mid-task, instead
# of dispatching a round into a busy worker (rules/agent-team-operation.md
# Dispatch Safety).
#
# Design choices, shared with the other SessionStart hooks:
#   - It DOES something (reads the live roster), it does not re-state a rule.
#   - Silent in every session that is not a team session: outside Herdr, with
#     no herdr binary, or with no named worker but this pane.
#   - Informative only. Never blocks (always exits 0), never exits 2.
#   - The roster read is skills/herdr-teamlead/roster.sh, the same script the skill
#     calls, so "who is on the team" has one implementation.
#
# Contract:
#   stdin : consensus SessionStart JSON — not read (the hook needs none of it).
#   stdout: one JSON object {"additionalContext": "<status>"} whose text begins
#           with the "Session-start status — " marker
#           (rules/hook-action-reporting.md), listing each named worker as
#           "<name> (<kind>) <state>". Emitted only when at least one named
#           worker other than this pane is live; every other outcome is silent.
#   exit  : always 0. Every best-effort failure emits an actionable stderr
#           warning and no-ops (rules/error-handling.md Shell Error Handling).
#   state : none.
#   env   : HERDR_ENV must be 1. HERDR_BIN passes through to roster.sh; the
#           tests point it at a fake herdr.
